- Calculates confidence scores

**2. Rules Engine** (`rulesEngine.js`)
- Loads rules from JSON
- Validates extracted data
- Applies conditional logic
- Generates scorecards
- Determines required documents
- Field-level and document-level validation

**3. Loan Data Service** (`loanDataService.js`)
- CRUD operations for loans
- Document storage
- Status updates
- File-based storage (prototype)

**4. Conditions Service** (`conditionsService.js`)
- Auto-generates conditions from validation
- Suggests corrective actions
- Tracks condition status
- Handles document requests
- Condition statistics

### Data Files

- Loan ID: CMG-2024-001
- Borrower: Michael Thompson
- Co-Borrower: Jennifer Thompson
- Loan Amount: $450,000
- Property: Irvine, CA
- Complete MISMO 3.5 structure:
  - Personal information
  - Employment (W2 + W2)
  - Assets (checking, savings, retirement)

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **No Database** - Uses JSON files for prototype
2. **No Authentication** - Open API for now
3. **No Sample PDFs** - Can't fully test extraction yet
4. **No Error Recovery** - Basic error handling only
5. **No File Cleanup** - Uploaded files not deleted
6. **Single Loan** - Only one sample loan currently
7. **No Tests** - No unit or integration tests

## üí° Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| OpenAI GPT-4o | Best for flexible document extraction |
| JSON Storage | Simplest for prototype, easy to migrate |
| Express.js | Lightweight, familiar, easy to extend |
| React + Vite | Modern, fast, good developer experience |
| PDF-parse | Simple PDF text extraction |
| No Database | Prototype phase, JSON is sufficient |
| Rules in JSON | Non-technical users can edit |

## üéì Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- AI integration for document processing
- Rules engine architecture
- Conditional business logic
- RESTful API design
- Microservices pattern (services folder)
- Configuration-driven development
- Scoring algorithms
